# API for Bing Chat
I am going to send a repository to GitHub, but I need it to be analyzed.
This API is a chat bot for querying Bing Chat with a Node.js app.
I am using the 'chatgpt-api' library from the 'transitive-bullshit' repository.

# How to install
Create a new project with Node.js and you need the following libreries:

| libreary | npm | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| dotenv | npm install dotenv | 
| express | npm install express | 
| BingChat | npm install bing-chat --save | 

Run on your terminal

```
  node app.js 
```

You see:
